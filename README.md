## Introduction ðŸš€

Welcome to the Messenger SDK Integration Guide! Messenger offers an all-encompassing logistics platform designed to streamline and finance end-to-end supply chain operations, aiding businesses and logistics asset owners in achieving an efficient supply chain framework.

Our Order APIs empower businesses in need of dispatch services by connecting them with a vast network of Messenger Riders to facilitate their deliveries seamlessly. This document serves as a comprehensive guide and detailed specification for integrating the Messenger APIs into your application, ensuring a smooth and effective implementation. Explore the detailed information provided here to seamlessly integrate our SDK into your respective application and optimize your logistics and supply chain operations.

### Get Messenger SDK Features ðŸš€

- **Seamless Integration Experience:** The Messenger SDK streamlines the integration process, allowing users to interact with Messenger APIs effortlessly, facilitating a smooth and efficient integration into your application.

- **Rapid Development:** Experience accelerated development with simplified methods and enhanced autocompletion, enabling developers to expedite product releases and reduce time-to-market for your logistics and supply chain solutions.

- **Simplified API Interaction:** Users can harness robust logistics functionalities without the need for direct interaction with the Messenger APIs, simplifying the development process and making it more accessible for your team.

- **Typed Responses for Precision:** The Messenger SDK automatically generates type definitions for API responses, ensuring the development of robust and error-free code. Enjoy a more structured development experience with effortlessly typed responses.

- **Enhanced Code Documentation:** Benefit from comprehensive JSDoc support that enriches code documentation. Developers can access descriptive and detailed information, making it easier to comprehend and leverage the full capabilities of the Messenger SDK.

- **Effective Error Handling:** The SDK facilitates efficient error handling, offering detailed information for seamless debugging. Developers can quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring a reliable integration and enhancing the overall stability of your logistics application.

## Installation ðŸ’½

To install the **SDK** in your application, you can install using `npm, yarn, pnpm or bun`

**Npm**

```bash
npm install messenger-merchant
```

**Yarn**

```bash
yarn add messenger-merchant
```

**Bun**

```bash
bun add messenger-merchant
```

## Usage

While the Messenger SDK prioritizes simplicity for developers, I'll provide a brief overview of each method to enhance understanding. To begin using the Messenger SDK, import the **CreateMessengerClient** from the **{{package name}}** package. That class provides the interface to work with the **SDK**.

```typescript
import MessengerClient from messenger-merchant;
```

Next, instantiate a new instance of the **CreateMessengerClient** class, enabling interaction with its methods. This class requires 3 arguments:

1. Messenger Public Key
2. Messenger Private Key
3. Environment

You can obtain the Public and Private Keys from creating an account with messenger. To do this, go to

```typescript
const messengerClient = new MessengerClient(
  process.env.MESSENGER_PUBLIC_KEY as string,
  process.env.MESSENGER_PRIVATE_KEY as string,
  process.env.NODE_ENV as string
);
```

### SDK Typed Response

The Messenger SDK ensures a structured approach to response handling by providing typed responses for every method call. Each method call yields a base response object, offering valuable insights into the status, success or failure of the call, along with a descriptive message. This approach mimics traditional API calls, enabling developers to easily catch errors and tailor their applications based on the method's status.

In TypeScript, the base response object is defined as follows:

```typescript
export interface BaseResponse {
  message: string;
  data?: {};
}
```

This response object allows you to extract crucial information from each method call, including the accompanying message, and any data returned by the method. Leveraging this structured response format enhances error handling and empowers developers to build robust applications with confidence.

### Wallets

To make use of the Messenger Order API, you first need to fund your wallet. Follow the steps below to initiate the wallet funding process using the Messenger SDK.

### Live Environment

When you are ready to go live, fund your wallet by making a transfer to the account details provided to you when your account was first created. Follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the account details sent to you during the account creation process.

2. Use the Messenger SDK to initiate a transfer to the provided account details.

3. Upon successful transfer, your wallet will be funded and ready for live order processing.

### Staging Environment (Sandbox)

In the test environment, we utilize a transfer simulator to fund the wallet. Follow these steps to fund your wallet in the sandbox environment:

1. Access Monipoint, our virtual account handler, using the following link: [Monipoint](https://monipoint.example.com).

2. Use the account number provided in your welcome email to log in.

3. Navigate to the funding section within Monipoint to simulate a transfer to your wallet.

4. Confirm the simulated transfer, and your wallet in the sandbox environment will be successfully funded.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your wallet is adequately funded for testing purposes in the sandbox environment or for live order processing in the production environment.
